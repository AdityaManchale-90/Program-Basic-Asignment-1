# 3. Write a Python program to find the area of a triangle?

# This program written by considering the formula, A = (h*b)/2
# Assuming user know the values of base and height of the triangle.

b = input("Enter the base of the triangle: ")
h = input("Enter the height of the triangle: ")
a = 0.5 * float(b) * float(h)
print("Area of the triangle for the given input is: ", a)

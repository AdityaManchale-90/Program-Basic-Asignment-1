# 2. Write a Python program to do arithmetical operations addition and division.?

# This program is written to take inputs from user. In result we get both sum and division of the input.

a = input("Enter a number: ")
b = input("Enter a non-zero number: ")
sum = float(a) + float(b)
print("Sum of the entered number is: ", sum)
div = float(a) / float(b)
print("Division of the entered number is: ", div)

# 2. Write a Python program to do arithmetical operations addition and division.?

# This program is written to take inputs from user & operation to be done.

a = input("Enter a number: ")
b = input("Enter another number: ")
oper = input("Enter type of operation to be done(s for sum & d for division): ")

if oper == "s":
    sum = float(a) + float(b)
    print("Sum of the entered number is: ", sum)
elif oper == "d":
    div = float(a) / float(b)
    print("Division of the entered number is: ", div)
else :
    print("Wrong input. Try again.")
